# GuiCheckers
GuiCheckers is a checkers program written by Jon Kreuzer. It is probably the strongest open source checkers program. It runs on Windows, and can run stand-alone with its own UI or as a CheckerBoard DLL. There is a project file for compiling it with VS2015. Jon has stopped developing it, and I have made some minor changes to it integrate it better with CheckerBoard, so I have created this GitHub repos to make the updated sources available. Jon Kreuzer's web site: http://www.3dkingdoms.com/checkers.htm.

GuiCheckers can use a 6-piece DTW endgame database that was created by Ed Trice. The files are too large to host on GitHub. I will post a link to download the files when I have found a suitable host.
